# ðŸŒ± piart-di: Pixel Art, design interface

A web app designed for crafting simple pixel art drawings that can be exported for use in other projects.

You can access the live version of the project [here](https://piart-di.vercel.app/).

This is mostly a playground, something to have fun, an experiment around the idea of "learning in public" that means that the code may change drastically as I experiment with it.

The expected timeframe for this app is approximately one year, with the goal of being "ready" by the end of 2024. I want to see how much I can make doing small updates over a long period of time.

## New in this version!

**2311150357:** The drawings can be saved and retrieved in a list.

## Next steps:

- Implement nice save and load modal
- Implement an option so save the drawing as a SVG file
- Be able to scale the drawing so it looks like pixel art but big.
