This is a small project to create a simple web interface that helps me create pixel art. The idea is simple: it's just a web app where I can create pixel art and then export it for use in other projects.

I want to keep it extremely simple. For now, I'm focusing on one-color drawings and avoiding functionality outside the drawing itself. Also, the idea is to learn about Solid.js, so I need to review the code from time to time and improve the architecture.

The project is currently live here: https://svg-drawer-rouge.vercel.app/

New! The drawing gets saved to local storage, which can be good or bad depending on your patience to draw.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review the code and look for improvements, errors and re-organization. Ask for good practices and investigate.
2. Add the ability to draw by painting with a finger or mouse.
