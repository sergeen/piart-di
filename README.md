# ðŸŒ± PADI: Pixel Art Design Interface

A web app designed for crafting simple pixel art drawings that can be exported for use in other projects.

This is mostly a playground, something to have fun, an experiment arround the idea of "learning in public" and a way to explore the posibilities of the impact of very small updates over long periods of time.

I'm using this project to learn Solid.js, so I will probably change the code structure a lot and constantly refactor.

The expected timeframe for this app is approximately one year, with the goal of being "ready" by the end of 2024.

You can access the live version of the project [here](https://svg-drawer-rouge.vercel.app/).

## NEW!

**2311150357:** Now, the color can be selected. The default is transparent, and there is spacing between the blocks to make it easier to use.

## NEXT STEPS:

- Implement drawing by dragging the cursor or touch.
- Save the drawing as a svg
